## Thanks!

The workshop on Field Robotics 2025 is over and was a tremendous success! We received many contributions, out of which the presented papers are listed in the following section, high-quality talks, and had estimated the attendance to more than 300 researchers. The workshop was the most crowded room of the day, demonstrating a clear need for field roboticists to gather and share experiences and lessons learned.

# Context
<div style="text-align: justify">
Field robotics tackles the problem of developing, deploying, and evaluating autonomous mobile systems in unstructured and often dynamic environments. Typical commercial applications are in agriculture, construction, mining, and forestry. The range of physical mediums is also very diversified: in the air, on the ground, underground, on the water, and underwater. These can be located on Earth, or on other celestial bodies (e.g., planets, moons, or asteroids). As such, field robotics works under wildly diverse and radically different assumptions than other areas of robotics, which tend to have well-defined working hypotheses. Therefore, this creates its own set of challenges. This workshop will thus offer the opportunity to present work and discuss how these unique challenges can be solved.

This workshop will bring together experts, researchers, and practitioners to discuss the latest advancements in field robotics. Participants will gain valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities that arise in deploying robots in diverse field scenarios, such as rugged terrains, remote locations, and hazardous environments. Practical case studies and real-world applications will be presented to showcase the successful, and not-so-successful cases of field robotics. The workshop will encourage fruitful dialogues and collaborative discussions, culminating by a panel at the end of the workshop. Attendees will leave with a comprehensive understanding of the state-of-the-art technologies, the main actors, and upcoming challenges. As major outcomes, we aim to consolidate the community around field robotics and prepare an editorial article on the current status of robotics deployed in real environments.

# Competition

This year, the field robotics workshop features multiple competition tracks designed to address key challenges in field robot deployment.
The competition focuses on SLAM and vision-based tasks of 2D and 3D Semantic Segmentation in challenging environments like dense vegetation. 
Participants have access to extensive datasets, including recordings from wheeled, tracked, and multi-legged robots navigating challenging off-road terrains from the [GOOSE](https://goose-dataset.de/) and [GOOSE-Ex](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18788) dataset. 
The SLAM dataset features radar-based perception data for off-road environments and multispectral data for scenarios where passive sensors are crucial. 

The top-performing teams are invited to present their results during the workshop poster sessions and receive prizes.
The competitions are open to all field robotics researchers and practitioners.

Please visit the competition websites for more details:
